# Lotus Common
The shared module present within most of our Python repos.

## What is this?
As the name suggests, it is a collection of of modules, objects and wrappers commonly utilised within the Lotus stack. It is essentially a way to simultaneously:
- Ensure code remains consistent within the entire project.
- Ensure objects are up to date within the entire project.
- Avoid rewriting the same code in different sections of the stack.
- Make everything easier to maintain.
- Ensure a single change only requires to be made only once in the whole stack.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 (due to modern async and syntax)
